This Qt library is in fact a wrapper around MaxMind's GeoIP library. Therefor,
it also uses MaxMind's GeoIP databases.

While this Qt library is released into the public domain (see UNLICENSE), the
same cannot be said of MaxMind's GeoIP library, which is released under the
LGPL license (see libGeoIP/COPYING).
No changes have been made to any of the files in the libGeoIP directory. It is
the latest version they provide: 1.4.7 beta 9. The Makefile has been removed,
in favor of a newly added .pro file.
